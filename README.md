# LEMMS, a programming language

This repository is for the practical module **Programming Language Design and Implementation** of the **Technical University of Berlin**.

The goal is to work in a team to describe the specifications for a domain-specific language and implement a compiler or a parser for the language. We chose to go with the latter.
